## [Flickr Photo Density Map](/Portfolio/Maps/Flickr)
<img src="images/Flickr_Map.png"/><br>
Using Flickr’s API, I counted every instance of a geotagged photo for each city and mapped them using a dynamic hex-grid choropleth map. Using the bottom slider or the legend’s inputs, you can change the classification of the data, allowing you to see local variation that would be otherwise invisible in a small-scale (i.e. zoomed out) map. Clicking on any location will show you some photos taken there, as well as a link to Google Street View.

## [Arizona Border Death Map](/Portfolio/Maps/Arizona-Migration)
<img src="images/Arizona_Map.png"/><br>
Every year, hundreds of migrants perish at the Southern border as they make their way across the scorching Sonoran desert. Deaths were rare before the Clinton administration, when the border was first militarized with the use of stadium lights, thermal sensors, check points, vehicle barriers and of course, walls. These efforts have been pushing migrants to increasingly dangerous paths, and even though border crossing has decreased significantly over the last two decades, the number of deaths has not.
This animated map is intended to show the evolving geography of migrant deaths as new patrol stations and border walls are erected. Once the animation is over, a slider will appear that allows you to scroll through time. Zooming in will reveal each victim’s name, age, and location.

## [Project 3 Title](/Open-Source-GIS/lab9)
<img src="images/Lab9.png"/><br>
Recently, big data has gathered the interest of many, and in the geography community, its use in the study of natural disasters and its potential as a tool for emergency responders are being examined closely. In this lab, the goal is to become familiar with twitter's API through rStudio, and import the geolocated tweets to PostGIS and GeoDa to perform spatial analysis. Specifically, we will examine activity during Hurricane Dorian that devastated the Bahamas and affected the East Coast of the United States. Of course, this event was in part overshadowed by DJT's infamous 'sharpiegate'. By examining twitter activity, I wish to uncover whether such a controversy could alter tweet activity in significant ways to affect emergency responders or academic research.

## [Project 3 Title](/Open-Source-GIS/lab8)
<img src="images/Lab8.png"/><br>
This lab has two large goals. Firstly, we will reproduce a vulnerability map published in Applied Geography by Malcolm, Weaver, and Krakowka using the datasets and methodologies outlined in their article. Secondly, we will critique the methods used by the authors and discuss the broader issue of replicability in vulnerability analysis. This lab is an opportunity to dive deep into the reproducibility and replicability discussion that is becoming a hot issue in the social science community.

## [OSM Data and PostGIS for vulnerability assessment](/Open-Source-GIS/lab6)
<img src="images/Lab6.png"/><br>
I used OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Tanzania Resilience Academy (RA) data to quantify a dimension of vulnerability, and create a visualization at the sub-ward level to aid policy action. I specifically looked at the vulnerability caused by the build-up of rubbish in areas that are near existing drain blockages, but are inaccessible by vehicle. The geo-analysis was done using PostGIS.

## [Comparing quality of DEM raster datasets](/Open-Source-GIS/lab3)
<img src="images/Lab3.png"/><br>
I compared the data quality of two DEM raster datasets, ASTER and SRTM in my study region of Mount Kilimanjaro using a terrain analysis program SAGA. I made sense of the  areas of low resolution in the SRTM data by looking at its metadata (i.e. data provenance) and by considering the data capture method. I also analyzed how this raster error propagates when performing terrain analysis on the problematic regions.

## [Creating open source tool for QGIS](/Open-Source-GIS/lab1)
<img src="images/Lab1.png"/><br>
As an exercise and introduction to open source GIS, I made a QGIS model with an open source license and a help document. The model was designed to be used in urban geography analysis, specifically for distance-decay analysis that conceptualize the urban space as being organized radially out from the central business district. The tool calculates the distance and direction with respect to the central business district for each polygon in the input shapefile. I tested the model with census data and plotted it using DataPlotly.
