## [Flickr Photo Density Map](/Portfolio/Maps/FLickr)
<img src="images/Flickr_Map.png"/>
Using Flickr’s API, I counted every instance of a geotagged photo for each city and mapped them using a dynamic hex-grid choropleth map. Using the bottom slider or the legend’s inputs, you can change the classification of the data, allowing you to see local variation that would be otherwise invisible in a small-scale (i.e. zoomed out) map. Clicking on any location will show you some photos taken there, as well as a link to Google Street View.

[Arizona Border Death Map](/Portfolio/Maps/Arizona-Migration)
<img src="images/Arizona_Map.png"/>
      Every year, hundreds of migrants perish at the Southern border as they make their way across the scorching Sonoran desert. Deaths were rare before the Clinton administration, when the border was first militarized with the use of stadium lights, thermal sensors, check points, vehicle barriers and of course, walls. These efforts have been pushing migrants to increasingly dangerous paths, and even though border crossing has decreased significantly over the last two decades, the number of deaths has not.
     This animated map is intended to show the evolving geography of migrant deaths as new patrol stations and border walls are erected. Once the animation is over, a slider will appear that allows you to scroll through time. Zooming in will reveal each victim’s name, age, and location.
