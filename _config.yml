  Hello! I am a 2021 graduate from Middlebury College who studied Physics, Geography, and French. I am interested in cartography, design, spatial analysis and data visualisation. Here I share some things I've been working on.
  <br><br>
  I was born in Tokyo and split my time between there and Brookline, MA up to high school. Then I moved to the beautiful Middlebury College nested between the Adirondacks and Green Mountains. Some of my hobbies include homebrewing, carpentry, and darkroom photography.
